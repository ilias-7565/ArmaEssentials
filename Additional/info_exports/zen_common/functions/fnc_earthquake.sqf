 * Creates an earthquake effect (blur, camera shake, sound).
 * If an earthquake is already active, this earthquake will take place after it finishes.
 * Unscheduled equivalent of BIS_fnc_earthquake.
 *
 * Arguments:
 * 0: Intensity (0..3) <NUMBER>
 *
 * Return Value:
 * None
 *
 * Example:
 * [2] call zen_common_fnc_earthquake
