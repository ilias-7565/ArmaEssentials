
!!! To avoid chance of loosing a lot of time, forget about downloading mods without adding each to at least 1 external list.

### Steam

There is no adequate/fast way to: manage groups of Mods (like copying or splitting). So we use Web Browsers for this.

This repository's sorted tree, including current Mods selection, is packed into the bookmarks.html file.

Exported Bookmarks .html -s can be dragged onto the default Arma 3 Launcher. But you'll first have to Unsubscribe from all Mods, because the Launcher won't put the new ones into Loaded/selection list.

Sometimes Steam doesn't delete some mods for some time after Unsubscribing: in it's interfaces, or using "Unsubscribe all Steam Workshop mods" in the default Arma 3 Launcher.

Some browsers doesn't show all locations of bookmarks for the opened/current page, so we duplicate some sorting to the dev folder (for keeping only 1 bookmark per page). THat can badly affect searching for broken Mods.

### Arma3Sync

Allows you to separate/sort downloaded Mods to locally stored link trees,
	 and load multiple of such.  
[Our pack](Additional/ArmA3Sync).
* It requires having only newly subscribed Mods' Symbolic Links in the !Workshop folder,
	 otherwise it requires to manually select each such Mod from a list of all.
* It doesn't provide any info or links for the Mods. And has horrible list/tree controls.

### Other

* Arma 3 Mod Preset Launcher is less functional than Arma3Sync, and even outdated.
